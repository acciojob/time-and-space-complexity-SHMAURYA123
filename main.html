	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of its input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time. Algorithms with lower time complexity are considered more efficient as they take less time to execute, especially when dealing with large input sizes.</p>
   <p>Space complexity, often denoted as <b>Space Complexity</b>, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute as a function of the length of its input. It indicates how much additional memory an algorithm needs to complete its task. Algorithms with space complexity of O(n) means that the amount of memory they require is directly proportional to the input size, making them efficient in terms of memory usage.</p>
